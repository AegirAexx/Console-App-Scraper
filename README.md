# Web scraper .NET

## Purose

A simple web scraper using .NET. This is just a simple demo to be used as a reference when I need to implement it later in other projects.

This is a demo of scraping a static web page. Initial insperation and ideas were taken [here](https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/web-scraping-csharp/). In the article there are also suggestions about scrapping dynamic client-side rendered JS pages but I havn't done that yet.

## Nuget Packages
